# ![Logo](/images/mp64.png) Maths Pathways Auto Completer Bot
**Please note this is a proof of concept and I do not intend for it to be used in malicious ways.**  
This Program utilises Microsoft's [Power Automate](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/power-automate/9NFTCH6J7FHV) and is designed to automatically complete Math Pathways Modules.

---

## Some Context & info
From the first time I used Math Pathways I've been eager to make some sort of tool that automates the proccess of clicking through all the questions for me. I had tried multiple ways including attempting to make a browser extension, nodeJS script, and python script but all of those had some sort of limitation. This is until I came across a tool called [Power Automate
](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/power-automate/9NFTCH6J7FHV) made by Microsoft. It allows you to automate many things including browsers (via the use of a browser extension added by the program)

## How do I do this Myself?
Below you will find some videos and screenshots of this program working, and a tutorial to set it up yourself.

### What you will need
- A Windows system
- A Microsoft account (required for Power Automate)
- [Power Automate desktop program](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/power-automate/9NFTCH6J7FHV)
- Chrome (for easiest setup) or any other browser
- Math Pathways account
- Decent experience with Windows and/or Programming

### Installing Power Automate
First and foremost, you must install [Power Automate](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/power-automate/9NFTCH6J7FHV) from the Microsoft store.

### Installing browser extension/add-on
For this program to work properly you'll also need the browser extension for your browser of choice
- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/microsoft-power-automate/gjgfobnenmnljakmhboildkafdkicala)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/power-automate-desktop/)
- [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/microsoft-power-automate/njjljiblognghfjfpcdpdbpbfcmhgafg)  

Installing the extension should be quite straightforward

### Creating the flow
Now we have everything we need setup, it's time to create the flow!  
If you followed the intructions correctly you should be at the Power Automate home/dashboard, simply click "New flow" and then name your flow whatever you wish.

### ℹ️ Changing/Configuring your code (MORE OPTIONS TO BE ADDED SOON)
There are a few things you might want to change before you run your code.  
❕ It is required that you change the URL of your Math Pathways class (the URL which you use to access Math Pathways), at the top of all the code click the three dots on the right of the MPClass varible then click edit and set the URL accordingly.

  ![three dots of MPClass varible](/images/seturl.gif)
</details>

If you know what you are doing you may change any of the code to meet your needs.  
ℹ️ Once you've finished making any changes make sure to save your flow!

### Running the Math Pathways Auto Bot
Congrats! You made it to the fun part.  
To run the Bot, click the ▶️ button located next to the save button.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Show Image(s)</strong></summary>

  ![Run the flow](/images/runflow.png)
</details>

This will launch a browser window and automaically open the URL you set as your Math Pathways class. If your're not already logged in, a message box will pop up asking you to login.

![three dots of MPClass varible](/images/loginmsg.png)

Select your user and enter your password to login, the Bot will not continue until you click "OK" on the message pop up.  
When you click "OK" you should be redirect to *your-mpclass*.com<strong>/work</strong> and you will get another message pop up which when you are ready to start the Bot click "OK".  

![three dots of MPClass varible](/images/startbotmsg.png)

ℹ️ **PLEASE NOTE:** If you don't already have a module started, are doing the warm up for the module, or currently have test the Bot will not work.  
ℹ️ **MAKE SURE:**
- If you don't have a module started, start one and complete the warm up if you have one, then you can start the bot
- If you are still in a warm up for a module, complete the warm up then start the bot
- If you have a test, [stop the bot](put link to stopping bot) and complete the test
- The "Check my answer" and "Complete question" are visable on screen at all times, as the bot uses [OCR](https://g.co/kgs/gC1Fmd) to find and click the buttons. This also means you may need to manually scroll down at times. (for the best results, maximize the browser window)

Here is a short video of the bot working on a module.
