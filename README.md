**Please note this is a proof of concept and I do not intend for it to be used in malicious ways.**

## Some Context & info
From the first time I used Math Pathways I've been eager to make some sort of tool that automates the proccess of clicking through all the questions for me. I had tried multiple ways including attempting to make a browser extension, nodeJS script, and python script but all of those had some sort of limitation. This is until I came across a tool called [Power Automate
](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/power-automate/9NFTCH6J7FHV) made by Microsoft. It allows you to automate many things including browsers (via the use of a browser extension added by the program)

## How do I do this Myself?
Below you will find some videos and screenshots of this program working, and a tutorial to set it up yourself.

### What you will need
- A Windows system
- A Microsoft account (required for Power Automate)
- [Power Automate desktop program](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/power-automate/9NFTCH6J7FHV)
- Chrome (for easiest setup) or any other browser
- Math Pathways account
- Decent experience with Windows and/or Programming

### Installing Power Automate
